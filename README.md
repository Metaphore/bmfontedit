# BMFont Editor

Small tool to add/edit glyphs in bitmap font (angel code format).


I spent few days all over net trying to find tool that will help me extend already generated bitmap font with new characters.
Of course I could do that all by hand, but when you need to add ~100 glyphs, correct their params and see if they looks properly - it's suicide.
My searches brought me to conclusion that this world totaly in lack of such a thing and I intended to write it by my own.
